## Extended details and known issues

Additional detail and explanation of the esoteric parts of CleanMoon.css.

#### `pre, code, kbd, samp`

The `font-family: monospace, monospace` hack fixes the inheritance and scaling
of font-size for preformatted text. The duplication of `monospace` is
intentional. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Davidgothberg/Test59).

#### `sub, sup`

Normally, using `sub` or `sup` affects the line-box height of text in all
browsers. [Source](https://gist.github.com/413930).

#### `select`

By default, Chrome on OS X and Safari on OS X allow very limited styling of
`select`, unless a border property is set. The default font weight on `optgroup`
elements cannot safely be changed in Chrome on OSX and Safari on OS X.

#### `[type="checkbox"]`

It is recommended that you do not style checkbox and radio inputs as Firefox's
implementation does not respect box-sizing, padding, or width.

#### `[type="number"]`

Certain font size values applied to number inputs cause the cursor style of the
decrement button to change from `default` to `text`.

#### `[type="search"]`

The search input is not fully stylable by default. In Chrome and Safari on
OSX/iOS you can't control `font`, `padding`, `border`, or `background`. In
Chrome and Safari on Windows you can't control `border` properly. It will apply
`border-width` but will only show a border color (which cannot be controlled)
for the outer 1px of that border. Applying `-webkit-appearance: textfield`
addresses these issues without removing the benefits of search inputs (e.g.
showing past searches).
